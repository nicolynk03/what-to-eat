# What to Eat?
This side-project was created because I often found myself confused on deciding what to eat in a day. It was started as a simple website development project that allows me to add food idea (as item in a list) for that week. Within each food idea, it also allows me to add necessary ingredients (and indicates whether I need to buy it or if it is already available at home). Eventually, this will allow me to invite friends to collaborate on food idea.

This will also be further developed into a mobile application (maybe Flutter) in the future! Please keep an eye out on this. :D
